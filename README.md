# ML_Password_Classifier
A small password classifier project I wanted to try and do for practice and use for a demo at an event for my current job in security.

This would not have been possible without the help from Faizan's code example of his project found here: https://medium.com/@faizann20/machine-learning-based-password-strength-classification-7b2a3c84b1a6

His example introduced me to the TFIDF tokenizer for text data and allowed me to get something working for a classifier.
